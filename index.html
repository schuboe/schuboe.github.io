             <p class="myText">I hold a Ph.D. in Linguistics from Goethe University Frankfurt. Until 2022, I worked as a Research Associate and professor at the University of Stuttgart. 
             In 2023, I received training in Data Science at WBS Coding School and have started a position as Research Data Management Coordinator at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).</p>
            
            <p class="myText">My research interests lie in the area of phonetics and phonology, in particular speech prosody: 
            How do speakers encode meaning by means of suprasegmental phonetic features and how do listeners perceive them?
            I conduct research on the prosodic patterns in languages as diverse as German, Hungarian, Tswana, and Javanese, mainly focusing on 
            syntax-prosody interface relations, prosodic phrasing, and the prosodic encoding of information structure. Check out my publications for further details.</p>
                
            <p class="myText"">I teach courses related to my research interests. Each winter term, 
            I teach an introductory course in phonetics at the Schhool for Speech Therapy of the TÃ¼bingen University Hospital. 
            From 2013 to 2022, I taught graduate and undergraduate courses in phonetics/phonology, morphology, and dialectology at the University of Stuttgart.
            I also advised several BA and MA theses in English and General Linguistics.</p>
